## Once you are logged-In, you are shown other features as an authenticated Admin user. These are :

- ### `Cart` : 
User can view products that they add to cart. The option `add to cart` shows in Products, Details as well as Shop page only when user is logged-in. For each product, we have `delete` option, if user no longer wants that product. Each product has info - name , price and quantity. When user clicks `Order Now`, s/he is redirected to `checkout` page, which has all products info. and total amount of all products. If user clicks on `Order` option,s/he is redirected to `stripe` for payment through card. If payment is successful, we are redirected to `Orders` page, otherwise if payment is cancelled, we are redirected back to `checkout` page.
- ### `Orders` : 
User can see all orders placed by him/her. Info of each order - OrderId, product name, product quantity, and a link to get `invoice` of that order. When invoice link is clicked, a PDF is generated, that contains info - product name, product qty, product price per piece price , and final total amount paid.
- ### `Add Product` : 
Since authenticated user is also an admin user, s/he can add new products. While adding a product, admin user must provide title, single image (jpeg,png,jpg), price and description. Once `Add Product` is clicked, data of product is stored.
- ### `Admin Products` : 
This page shows all products that the logged In user has created, and not the ones from other admin users. For each Admin product, s/he is given two options - `Edit` and `Delete`. If admin user chooses to delete any product, that product is permanently deleted. If user chooses to `Edit` product, s/he can edit all fields (title, image, price, description) for that product and click on `Update Product`. On doing so, you will again be redirected to `Admin Products` page, and you can see the updated values for that product.
- ### `Logout` : 
Finally, a user can logout of his/her account using this option, and you will be redirected to `login` page.
